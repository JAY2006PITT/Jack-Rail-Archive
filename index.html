  <h2>Transportation Discoveries</h2>
    <p>The Frank B. Fairbanks Rail Transportation archive delves into the rail transportation system and a collection of documents and other materials of the train systems that can be found in the western parts of Pennsylvania. The materials included are photographs, posters, blueprints, maps, slides, railroad publications and other forms of documentation and the forms of data are all centered around the author's life. The collection is composed of knowledge that was derived from the years 1948-1993. All of the information that is included is the utter result of years of determination and a passion that was unyielding. There is a plethora of documentation and material from rail lines all over the world from over 200,000 miles traveled by rail. The two most valuable catalogs are the sixth and tenth edition light locomotives, these books are in perfect condition and cover topics like prices, size, hauling capabilities, and logging. The archive includes all of the documentation needed to see the progress and overall evolution of the rail transportation system. Having this archive allows many to have free use of the information that Frank B. Fairbanks so diligently pioneered.</p>

  <h2>Connecting Ideas</h2>
    <p>The document consists of Fairbanks publications including maps, postcards, slides, posters, and also placemats derived from a dining car. His publications played a significant role in the economy and contributed to many people by making his works public. The detail that went into his report was incredibly helpful and it included construction plans and unique details that were incorporated in the rail lines. He also included letters in the archive and these letters helped relay what his personal thoughts and feelings were about the railroads that he explored. This archive contributes greatly as a general resource in learning how a railroad operates and functions. The digital publication of Fairbanks works also greatly contributed to the economy as a whole because public access to the archive entices tourists to visit and it also helped businesses by getting people in the door. The archive provides the information regarding how a railroad is operated and all of the connecting points that help influence transportation of people and goods. But the relationship of the information of this archive to other sources just makes this archive that much more valuable. The information of this archive can be used as a supplement to other sources to provide a complete understanding of the railroad system. Researchers and engineers being able to use the immense amount of information can appreciate the work that was put in to make this information public for everyone. Now everyone can appreciate the creative documentation that was pivotal in shaping our economy and transportation systems.</p>

  <h2>Diverse Possibilities</h2>
    <p>This archive is important because of the wide range of usable information and how detailed the information is. The information on the document can be used by students, researchers, historians, and anyone interested in railroads and trains. Fairbanks included a wide range of research and this provided the opportunity for any user of the archive to analyze the historical commodities of rail transportation. The fields that could be affected by the archive include history, engineering, and studies of urbanization. The wide and diverse range of information provided allows the possibilities of use to be ongoing and can encourage use for many people. This can create innovation and help create some new approaches to transportation that we have never seen before. The implications of this historical data can be used for a variety of critical disciplines that all influence development in our society. These include but are not limited to transportation, history, and multiple different sciences.“The railroad system of the United States is a great piece of commercial machinery, essential to everyone in this complicated modern civilization” (Grant 1). The reason why the information of this archive is so important and useful is that it could help inspire and help people understand how to better our transportation systems with new innovative works. It may lead to a future with advancements in transportation and solutions to problems we may have had in the past. The archive is truly a revolutionary document that can help us better decipher our transportation systems.</p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Salute to Innovation</h2>
    <p>I personally conclude that this archive could be used to connect/challenge existing knowledge. It is very important to challenge knowledge in general because information is constantly changing and there are constant debates about how things could be improved and made safer and more efficient. The first step should be to promote collaboration between all of the people using the archive including historians, engineers, and researchers and connect the historical aspects to modern issues. Increasing the overall accessibility of this knowledgeable archive is of great importance. By making the information more available to the public researchers and engineers are able to better visualize the evolution of rail transportation in general. This then allows them to integrate solutions and other ideas to fix potential problems and limit failures of the transportation system. When the information of this archive is fully digitized and it is available to be easily accessed by anyone that requires it there will be a smooth progression of easily accessed information that can be used to promote new innovative ideas. Through the lens of Foucault, I think that this archive does validate a certain history, it affirms that the archive can be seen as a conduit to knowledge that can over shape how we interpret and recognize the history of our rail network. This archive ultimately proves how works like this can shape our society as a whole and the stories that derive from the text are heavily influenced by society and politics. This archive raises some questions that have us all asking. How can transportation be improved based on past innovation? How could rails be made differently so as to make them better and more efficient. It would be very beneficial if researchers analyzed these questions and helped boost our overall understanding and contribute to transportation changes in the future.</p>
